      "description": "The Tesla Model 3 is like the Apple iPhone of the motoring world – it’s made high-tech electric cars cool and popular for the mainstream. In part by making them more affordable and user-friendly, while also providing sensational performance.\n\nHow popular? Well, the Model 3 was the second bestselling car of any kind in 2021 – not just those powered by batteries. This upwards trend in electric car sales has continued into 2023, with Tesla still leading the charge.\n\nSo though you might put an initial surge of popularity down to pent-up demand (bringing the Model 3 to the right-hand drive UK market was a long, drawn-out affair that saw pre-orders hovering around for years), it’s clear the smallest Tesla has real staying power. It remains a key part of the EV market even after newer rivals such as the Polestar 2, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and BMW i4 have arrived on the scene.\n\nFor anyone shopping for a mid-size electric family car, it’s impossible to ignore. As this Tesla Model 3 review will explain, if you want fantastic performance, a long driving range and market-leading tech that includes a charging network that is second-to-none, few competitors even get close.",

      "description": "Audi took the wraps off the Q5 e-tron electric SUV at the Guangzhou motor show in China this week, welcoming the latest member of the MEB family—and one that could stay confined to the Middle Kingdom. It's slated to be produced by the SAIC Volkswagen joint venture in Anting, China, which has also been tasked with building the Volkswagen ID.6, to which it will be closely related.\n\nIntended to offer seating for six or seven, the Q5 e-tron will be offered with a choice of rear-wheel drive, badged somewhat opaquely as 40, or quattro all-wheel drive with a 50 badge on the back, both powered by the same 83.4-kWh (gross) battery. The single-motor version will serve up the now-familiar figure of 201 hp, while the dual-motor Q5 e-tron will dial that up to 302 hp. A third version with a smaller battery is also expected to land sometime later, likely with a 55-kWh battery underneath and a single motor out back.",

      "description": "The \"RS\" initials are taken from the German: RennSport – literally translated as \"racing sport\", and is Audi's ultimate 'top-tier' high-performance trim level, positioned a noticeable step above the \"S\" model specification level of Audi's regular model range line-up. Like all Audi \"RS\" models, the RS 6 pioneers some of Audi's newest and most advanced engineering and technology, and so could be described as a halo vehicle, with the latest RS 6 Performance having the equal most powerful internal combustion engine out of all Audi models, with the same horsepower and torque as the physically larger Audi S8 Plus. Unlike the A6 and S6, however, the RS 6's engines in the C5 and C6 iterations have not been shared with any other vehicle in Audi's lineup. However, for the C7 generation, the Audi RS 6 has the same 4.0L bi-turbo V8 engine as the Audi RS 7, with both being positioned at the top of the Audi S and RS range, and detuned variants of the same engines are found in the Audi S8, Audi A8, and Audi S6.\n\nBased on the A6 platform, the RS 6's engines are front-mounted and longitudinally oriented, while the transmission is mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle. Like all S and RS models, the RS 6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.\n\nThe C5 RS 6 was the fourth model to come out of Audi's private subsidiary company, \"quattro GmbH\". The first was the Audi RS 2 Avant, from a joint venture between Porsche and Quattro GmbH for the Audi marque. The second was the Audi C4 S6 Plus, produced from April 1996 to July 1997. The third was the 2000 Audi B5 RS 4; the fifth was the 2005 Audi B7 A4 DTM Edition saloon, and the sixth was the 2006 Audi B7 RS 4. The seventh and current (as of January 2010) Quattro GmbH model is the latest Audi C6 RS 6.\n\nProduction of the original Audi C5 RS 6 began in June 2002 and ended in September 2004. The second Audi C6 RS 6 was introduced at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The original RS 6 (C5) was the first Audi RS variant exported to North America, while the C6 and C7 RS 6 were only sold in Europe, with the C8 RS 6 again being offering in North America.",

It borrows that powertrain from the smaller Trailblazer; its style inspiration comes from the mid-size Blazer.

Yet the company's American misadventure was only a small part of the brand's wider commercial failure, one that had led to the loss of a reported $3.6 billion before it was fully absorbed into the Daimler empire in 2006.\n\nSmart, therefore, is taking a radically new direction and is being relaunched as a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and the Geely Group in China (which owns Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus, among other brands). Going forward, Smart will offer only EVs, and the first of these—the #1—uses Geely's SEA electric platform and will be built in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. It will be sold in China and Europe, but there are no plans to bring the brand back to the U.S. But as we figured you’d like to know what you're missing out on, we drove one in Portugal.",

      "description": "Over the years, driving a Toyota Prius was a rolling admission that you'd be willing to sacrifice everything on the altar of maximum fuel economy. Power and performance were axed, which makes some sense. Still, no previous Prius could crack even the lowly 10-second barrier to 60 mph. The list of forsaken attributes also included attractive styling, good driver ergonomics, and the barest modicum of handling prowess. The Prius has always been a one-trick pony that lacked actual ponies.",

This version has a crew-cab body and a short bed, although Ram hasn't yet said if it will offer any other configurations. Underneath the similar body lies a different platform, as the REV rides on a new architecture called STLA Frame, which is purpose-built for body-on-frame EV models. Based on the conventional look of this production truck, we don't expect it to incorporate many of the concept version's more outlandish features, such as its third-row jump seats, but there is a frunk."

That model, the just-introduced S580e, will be rolled out in a conservative fashion, first made available in China, then Thailand, then Europe. Electrification is coming to Mercedes-Maybach, but with the slow deliberation of one of the World War I dirigibles that the company's engines once powered.",
        "Should you wish to splatter rear-seat occupants with caviar and champagne, this new Mercedes-Maybach will sprint to highway speeds with most of the same vigor as its V-8– and V-12–powered cousins. But that sort of disrespectful behavior will get you in trouble, or, given the power wielded by the sort of people who can afford a Maybach, perhaps fired.",
        "No, a Mercedes-Maybach is for serene, airship-like gliding, which the S580e promises to do par excellence. For one thing, with all due respect to rapper Rick Ross, true Maybach music is measured in near silence. A V-8–powered Maybach murmurs at just 64 decibels of in-cabin noise at 70 mph. Capable of running purely on electrons, the S580e will be even more discreet.",
        "On a full charge, Mercedes says the Maybach S580e will run to a top speed of just under 87 mph on battery power and have a maximum range of 62 miles (per the optimistic global WLTP standard, at least). Versus a normal S-class, the Maybach variant is some seven inches longer for greater rear-seat room and can be optioned with all sorts of opulent goodies, including a rear-seat refrigerator and branded champagne glasses."

It borrows that powertrain from the smaller Trailblazer; its style inspiration comes from the mid-size Blazer.

The British brand still uses AMG engines and Benz's previous-gen infotainment systems. And Mercedes will honor all contracts and provide Aston with know-how and parts until the last of Aston's current gas-powered models bites the dust in 2026 or 2027.",

Quips a German insider: \"AMG and Pagani—that's true friendship. AMG and Aston is merely a business case with a fixed expiration date.\"",
        "While it is possible for Aston to extend the life cycle of its current portfolio, the marque is increasingly desperate for pace-setting fresh metal. Topping the list is a striking all-new EV coupe/convertible aimed squarely at the 2026 Ferrari F8 Tributo/Roma replacement. Executive chairman Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian billionaire who led a consortium to take a controlling stake in Aston Martin in 2020, slotted in former Ferrari CEO Amedeo Felisa to replace Moers. The chief sales and marketing manager Marco Matteacci, the CTO Roberto Fedeli, and other Italian high-flyers have been recruited from the deep Ferrari/Lamborghini/Maserati talent pool, but it's increasingly clear that talent isn't enough.

Stroll has also recently started talking again directly to Lucid's Peter Rawlinson and Eric Bach. Why Lucid? Because cooperating with the U.S. EV startup may well lead to a win-win scenario. The original idea conceived in late 2021 was for Lucid to cover vehicles up to $200,000, while Aston would cater to the $225,000-plus clientele including the supercar/hypercar segment. At the same time, the Americans would terminate their own patchy and underfinanced distribution scheme and join forces with the 134 established Aston dealers.",

Its snappy acceleration is typical of electric vehicles, and the smooth and quiet ride quality confirmed its luxury bona fides. Its stopping system expertly blended its traditional brakes with the obligatory regenerative braking system.
